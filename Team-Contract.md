When team members disagree?
Vote when major decisions
Fellow could be tiebreaker
Otherwise try a discussion
15 minutes max, then we Vote

What technologies?
Normal stuff plus material ui for now.

When a team member is frustrated?
Start with one on one, if that doesn't work then go to group
If that help, then Fellow
If it's a pair issue, try a rotation
If it's an effort issue, constructive one-on-one critism is best

Git commits:
Git master determines when commit planning will happen.
At least one branch commit every day.
When you submit to master, the other pair will review your work
2:30 meetup for a check-in
5:30pm usual commit time

Asking for help:
15 minutes of spinning your wheels before asking the group
If group doesn't know, then we go to fellow immediately to keep work going

How do we pair:
New pair every day, after we try all combinations we'll rediscuss

After hours work:
After hours solo work is okay, focus on refactoring if possible.
Or finish something you're working on.
Don't work no one else knows your doing.

Daily standup will be after REACTO. If too noisy we'll shuffle things around.

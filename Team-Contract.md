# Team Contract

## When team members disagree?
* Vote when major decisions
* Fellow could be tiebreaker
* Otherwise try a discussion
  *15 minutes max, then we Vote

## What technologies?
Normal stuff plus Material UI for now.

## When a team member is frustrated?
* Start with one on one, if that doesn't work then go to group
* If that doesn't help, then Fellow
* If it's a pair issue, try a rotation
* If it's an effort issue, constructive one-on-one critism is best

## Git commits:
Git master determines when commit planning will happen.
_At least_ one branch commit every day.
When you submit to master, the other pair will review your work
2:30 meetup for a check-in
5:30pm usual commit time

## Asking for help:
15 minutes of spinning your wheels before asking the group
If group doesn't know, _then_ we go to fellow immediately to keep work going

## How do we pair:
New pair every day, after we try all combinations we'll rediscuss

## After hours work:
After hours solo work is okay, focus on refactoring if possible.
Or finish something you're working on.
**Don't work that no one else knows you're doing.**

## Daily Standup
After REACTO. If too noisy we'll shuffle things around.
